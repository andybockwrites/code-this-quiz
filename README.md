# Code! This! Quiz!

## Description

Using completely original code, build a web application for an interactive quiz that stores local data using JavaScript and Web API's.

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


## Usage

When the user loads the page, a timer begins at the top right corner, and the user is presented with the first multiple choice question. If the user chooses the correct answer, they are awarded 20 points and the next question appears. But if the user answers incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from the time limit before presenting the the next question.

When the user finishes all five questions or the timer runs out, then the user's score is locally stored and can be accessed by clicking High Scores.
